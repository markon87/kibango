						<p>We are Miodrag Nikolic and Miljan Radovic. Our friendship and cooperation began totally  spontaneous with one beautiful, completely coincidental story and introduction on basis of, above all, enormous love towards animals and especially affinity towards Siberian huskies as a race, but also great mutual respect and admiring to honesty, decency and all other nice personal characteristics  which we recognized in each other. Those traits were foundation of most sincere friendship and joint cooperation over the years. Kibango Kennel was created and has been growing equally spontaneous.</p>
						<p>Over the years of being in a husky world and perfecting Siberian husky race we managed to breed and nourish more and more top quality show dogs on mutual satisfaction of us personally and owners of our dogs as well as their rich show careers. Based on those facts a conclusion and idea of building and creating a formally registered kennel has occurred as a perfectly logical next step, convinced that high class and distinctive type of huskies which we breed can maintain and further develop on higher level offering to people recognizable and characteristic huskies of long, slim and elegant anatomy which in combination with already beautiful and aesthetically distinctive look can impress even more.</p>

						<p>Name "Kibango" was created as a combination of last syllables of names of our first dogs (DzoKI, BeBA, DjaNGO), which are to this day one of most successful and most recognizable examples of Kibango Kennel which we are very proud of. Philosophy of Kibango Kennel and type of huskies we breed is based on relatively bigger anatomy, a bit longer legs, and most of all, slim, lean and elegant body line with which all of our dogs strife as prototype of perfect show specimens. The other things which also distinct our dogs are top quality fur, gentle and soft as a silk, a bit shorter in length and with all inspiring "silver" color towards which we nurture special affinity, and which we tend to favor in our breeding plans guided by a thought that it can aesthetically impress over the top. Therefore we tend to adjust and specialize our breeding based mostly on that particular color. Of course you can find huskies of all other colors in our kennel, being aware that it would be meaningless to limit a race with such varieties and richness in terms of color and symmetries of it.<br />It is very important to say that all of our dogs are completely in parameters of breed standard and postulates which we respect and are guided by, with aspiration that in terms of height, length and overall anatomy our dogs tend to be closer to upper limits of standard.</p>
						<p>We take special care of muzzle stop , well inborn ears, fur quality and strong, straight top line. All of this additionally contributes to effect of proud, noble and elegant stance of our dogs which will continue to be our main guideline in further developing of the race, using existing God given foundation of most impressive aesthetics which Siberian husky already possess being one of the most beautiful looking race in our opinion.</p>
						<p>Working and functioning of our kennel is based upon close cooperation and coherence relation of 2 cities - Nis / Serbia and Skopje / Macedonia which are residences of two of us. With only 200km apart they represent a good bases for effective activity division between two of us, enabling further development and market segmentation by covering territories of both Serbia and Macedonia through our work, commitment and overall presence in terms of shows, representing kennel, and possibility of promoting and selling dogs in larger area. This also enables a fact that most of our dogs own titles of Champions of both Serbia and Macedonia, and some of them also has titles of other countries in region, covering practically entire former Yugoslavian states, with intension of expanding and more intense competing in other nearby states in western Balkan and south-east Europe very soon, becoming internationally recognizable kennel. Some of our dogs are therefore available to be seen and bought in person both in city of Nis and Skopje leaving a choice to our clients. We also provide services of personal delivery of puppies and dogs across all Europe respecting a wish of a client.</p>
						<p>All of our dogs are given exclusively with contract of appropriate ownership and care which is our primary concern. Arrangement also states precise defining of rights and details of ownership, possibility of co-ownership, house delivery in person or by airplane and strictly regulated terms of future breeding because our biggest concern and asset is to preserve specific blood line and type of dogs we love and cherish.</p>
