					        			<p><b>Temper:</b> Siberian husky is globally recognizable as one of the most energetic and most active breeds in the world. Well known for his high energy level, relentlessness, hyperactivity, occasionally wild temper and frequently unpredictable spirit. Always ready to play, especially with kids which are always very attractive in his eyes, recognizing in them the exact same joyfulness, carelessness and readiness for play in every moment. It is a breed of beautiful, cheerful and endless smile on his face, but most of all a breed of incredibly positive, bright and genuinely benign character. In short, a true gooder! Tireless in play, with inexhaustible energy, they can often present a real challenge to an unaware future owner, having in mind that not everyone can meet their daily needed activities, being a breed that can practically run over a 40km per day without any bigger effort.  It is a dog that absolutely loves any kind of activity in general, from simple playing, to running with you, beside your bicycle, chasing across vast spaces, and even bikejoring and sled racing for more serious enthusiasts , which is basically what they are meant for and in which they are the best as a breed.</p>

				        				<p><b>Anatomy and physical characteristics:</b> We usually say for a husky that it is a dog in a wolf's body! Indeed, aesthetically they really do resemble a wolf, especially to those people who don't know the breed so much, so you will often hear on the street while walking with your dog comments from children like "Look it's a wolf!" etc. Some will be cautious and aware out of negligence and uncertainty, while majority will be attracted to his attractive appearance and grace wishing to approach and cuddle, to which he will always respond with cheerful and smiling face ready to interact and play. One is certain, wherever you go, you will be noticed! However, even though he can resemble a wolf by his appearance, we must make a distinctive difference and say that besides potential howling and fact that as all other dogs he does have origins from a wolf (with a bit greater aesthetic expression and similarities than other dogs) and therefore is classified as Canis Lupus Familiaris, Siberian husky by his doggy behavior and benign character really is a proper dog in every way, with all of the beautiful things that goes with him.<br />Geographical origin leads up to north-eastern Siberia, and they are categorized in Spitz genetic family of primitive dog type.</p>
				        				<p>They are recognizable by flush, luxurious, aesthetically beautiful, symmetrically perfect, double coat which consists of a layer of soft and dense undercoat and outer "protective" coat. In this combination his fur protects him from practically all weather, making him isolated from snow, cold, even rain. Because of that he logically prefers colder environment, where he naturally feels more comfortable. What is unimaginable for most of dogs, and for people often very strange, for a husky is totally natural. For example, they tend to sleep in open spaces rather than inside any shelter or house, especially when it is snowing or raining. They really like to let snow cover them completely creating a natural isolation of wind and cold. By doing that, they can for example, sustain and endure temperatures as low as -60 degrees Celsius. However, owners should be cautious about exposing their husky to extremely high temperatures in hot summers. It should be mentioned that, as opposed to general thinking and stereotype, husky has in fact greatly evolved and adapted to mediterranean warmer climate over the years, and as a result of that, huskies can be found almost in every part of the world today, including even hot parts of Africa (where we had personally exported some of our dogs in past years). Even though it is considered for a race that doesn't endure too much heat, it actually shows as a very endurable breed, being able to withstand harsh temperatures at which some other shorthaired breeds such as, for example, American staffords and pitbuls showed weakness. Why? Because husky with his complex coat isolates his skin and body from outer influences, reflecting even the heat, while shorthaired dogs are directly on impact of the sunrays and heat because of which they often become a victims of brain / heat strokes if they are left too long in the open without a shade to hide. In addition, another brilliant thing of evolution of husky breed is that they adapt themselves and their fur to their current environment by removing their undercoat (shedding process), and even change color of the hair itself (in summer it tends to be lighter in order to better reflect the sunlight, in winter it darkens so it could better absorb the light and therefore keep higher temperature as much as possible), while in winter periods they are typically in full coat. The coat itself is so well designed that it actually contains a small "air pockets" between undercoat and outer coat itself, creating a perfect air isolation. Shedding can also vary depending on husky's living environment, whether he's living in apartment or in open space of a house yard, so it can sometimes happen that a husky living in a condo can shed even during a winter (because of a warmer temperature in heated housing unit). This is yet another indicator of a brilliant and dynamic adaptability of the breed to every possible environment.<br />Therefore, we can conclude that this race is in every way physically very adaptable breed, enduring and in general very healthy without any genetically characteristical disease or hendicap.</p>
				        				<p>At the end, Siberian husky is a middle sized working dog with light anatomy. Males grow up to 28kg/ 60cm by standard and females up to 23kg/56cm. Ears are firmly erected and inborn, well protected with fur. Head and muzzle are also middle sized according to the body. Top line is straight and strong, as a trait needed for sled activities, and tail is well coated with magnificent foxy fur which he uses to show all of his beauty and be proud in walking. Husky goes with lots of color varieties and they are all in standard, from completely white to black, and in between well known color combinations such as grey-white, black-white, cream-white, light and dark red-white, orange-white, brown-white etc. There are even three-color variations. Color pattern can be also very different, from pinto undefined color symmetry to most common two-color symmetrical patterns and usually in 60-40 or 70-30 ratio towards darker shade. Color of eyes can also vary significantly from black to brown and well known blue for which they are most recognizable and loved. There are also possible variations of bi-color and even "party-color" (two colors in one eye). Once again, all this is a proof of one very impressive, physically interesting, vivid and attractive breed.</p>
				        				<p>Siberian husky, Samoyed and Alaskan Malamute are very close breeds, members of V Spitz Group and they all together have origins from original sled dogs. Since 2004. after completed researches in DNA analysis they are acknowledged as one of the oldest breeds in the world. It is commonly said that term "Husky" is a deviation of original word "Esky" which refers to Eskimo's and therefore their dogs.</p>
